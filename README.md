## What is Gulp

 Gulp.js is what we call a JavaScript Task Runner, it is Open Source and available on GitHub. It helps you automate repetitive tasks such as minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc. Gulp.js does not revolutionize automation but simplifies it tremendously.
 
### Gulp gives you:
- The ability to minify html, css, and javascript.
- The ability to compile Less, Sass, CoffeeScript, and ECMAScript 6.
- The availabilty of JavaScript Linting and CoffeeScript Linting.
- The ability to handle the renaming of a file.
- The ability to concatenate Files.
- The ability to add copyright information.
- The ability to mix all of these benifits together.
- The ability to automate all of these tasks by watching for them.
